# Process feedback for email campaigns sent using Amazon SES

This package is being used by [Mailcoach](https://mailcoach.app) to prepare Amazon SES accounts for use with Mailcoach.

You can use the code in this package, but we don't provide documentation or support. All documentation for Mailcoach itself is available [here](https://mailcoach.app/docs).
